# Team API template

This template for defining a Team API. A Team API is a description and specification that a team can define that tells others how to interact with that team.

At its basic level, the Team API should define:

The communication protocols between members of the team and anyone external to the team

The way the team accepts work items

The way the team delivers work items

The way the team shows progress on work items

## Overview

It can be useful to define a "Team API" for each team, to improve the team's clarity of purpose and help other groups understand how that team fits into the broader organization. Use this template to help teams think about how they would define their Team API.
